# John V Allen III

As a software developer, I have a passion for design and design systems. I believe that great design is just as important as great code in creating user-friendly interfaces and seamless user experiences. I bring a unique skill set to the table that sets me apart from my peers, with my ability to understand and implement design principles in my software development work.

I have designed responsive websites, created user interfaces for applications, and collaborated with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to produce high-quality software that meets the needs of my clients. I pay close attention to detail and commit to user-centered design principles in every project I undertake.
